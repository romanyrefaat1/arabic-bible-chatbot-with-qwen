description: Fix the issue that tailwind classes are not working
---

We are currently trying to fix the issue that tailwind classes are not working. For context: I had an old nextjs setup and I'm trying to update to the latest version. So we are currently at this problem as one of the common problems of upgrading from an old version of nextjs (13-14) to 15+.
